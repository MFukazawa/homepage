## Motivation
I build my original homepage using [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/), a tool that was almost immediately abandoned after I picked it up. I want a tool that doesn't lock me in to a framework, is fast, and will be around for a while. My first attempt at a homepage was also a test run for integration with Contentful, which is overkill.

## Criteria for Selection

```markdown
- Fast!
- Minimal JavaScript
- Excellent documentation
- Close™️ to HTML - the good parts of React and Vue
- Supports Markdown
- View Transitions
- Inbuilt support for i18n

```

It's only my second day of building with Astro, and I'm already very impressed. It was simple to get started and the syntax speaks for itself.
