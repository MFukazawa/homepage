<Layout title='About Me' description='About Micah Fukazawa'>
  <p>Hi, I'm Micah 👋🏼</p>

  <p>
    I'm an Engineering Manager and Frontend Developer based in Miyazaki, Japan,
    with a proven track record of leading high-performing technical teams and
    driving innovation in frontend development. Currently at Zeals, I've
    progressed from Frontend Engineer to Engineering Manager, where I lead a
    team of 8 engineers in developing and maintaining complex web applications.
    I specialize in React, TypeScript, and modern frontend architectures.
  </p>

  <p>
    Originally from California, USA, I'm bilingual in English and Japanese. I
    bridge cultural and technical gaps in international teams. I'm passionate
    about developer experience, fostering engineering excellence through
    mentorship, standardizing best practices, and creating environments where
    engineers can innovate freely.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not leading technical initiatives, you can find me teaching jazz
    big bands and coaching youth basketball.
